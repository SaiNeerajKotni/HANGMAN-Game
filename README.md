# HANGMAN-Game
A simple yet engaging text-based Hangman game written in Python. This project is designed for both beginners and those who enjoy word-guessing games.
Features:
    Randomized word selection from a predefined word list.
    Dynamic display of the word being guessed, updated based on user input.
    Visual representation of remaining lives using ASCII art.
    Real-time feedback for correct and incorrect guesses.


How to Play:
    Run the script in any Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
    Guess one letter at a time to figure out the hidden word.
    Each incorrect guess reduces your lives, and the Hangman graphic updates accordingly.
    Win by guessing all letters correctly or lose if you run out of lives.

Technologies Used:
    Python (Core libraries: random)
    Jupyter Notebook
Future Improvements (optional):
    Add difficulty levels with larger word lists.
    Enable support for multi-player mode or player-defined words.
    Improve visuals using GUI libraries like Tkinter or Pygame.
